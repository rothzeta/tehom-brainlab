description: Resolve a repository role and model route, prepare native harness instructions, and start one named worker in a sibling Herdr pane. Use for an authorized worker launch; excludes assignments, monitoring, prompts, evaluation, and benchmarks.

# Ruach Herdr

Run with Bun. Install the skill's pinned dependencies from this directory once:

```sh
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun test
```

The test suite binds local Unix-domain sockets to simulate native config reads. Its sandbox must permit socket binding; a prerequisite probe fails immediately with an explanation when binding is denied. Tests use temporary HOME/config directories and fake CLIs; they do not silently skip unsupported environments.

`resolve` without `--offline`, `start --dry-run`, and `start` all require live Herdr context (`HERDR_ENV=1`, the caller's `HERDR_PANE_ID`, and readable caller layout/live names), plus the selected native prerequisites. Resolve effective selection or prepare a launch without creating launch material or panes:

```sh
bun scripts/worker.ts resolve --name task-worker --role implementer --cwd /path/to/worktree
bun scripts/worker.ts start --dry-run --name task-worker --role implementer --cwd /path/to/worktree
```

For selection only without Herdr or native executable/config prerequisites, use:

```sh
bun scripts/worker.ts resolve --offline --name task-worker --role implementer --cwd /path/to/worktree
```

For direct selection, supply `--kind KIND --model NATIVE_MODEL [--effort LEVEL]` instead of a route. Otherwise the role's preferred route comes from `.agents/models.yaml`, `.agents/routing.yaml`, and `.agents/roles.yaml`; `--route ID` selects a declared alternative. There are no model defaults or harness fallbacks. Supply `--repo DIR` if Git cannot infer the intended canonical repository from cwd. Relative launcher paths resolve from invocation cwd. See [routing schema and root delegation](references/routing.md).

Start only after authorization to create the named worker:

```sh
bun scripts/worker.ts start --name task-worker --role implementer --cwd /path/to/worktree
```

`start` uses the same live context as resolve/dry-run: `HERDR_ENV=1` and the caller's `HERDR_PANE_ID`; preflight reads that pane and live names. It splits that pane once with `--no-focus`, preserves the requested cwd and executable PATH, and submits one `herdr agent start`. It never sends a task prompt or retries. Coordinator workflow skills remain visible according to existing native settings; workers receive the canonical role and known local `ruach-workflow-*` names are disabled where the native mechanism supports it. The launcher never supplies workflow bodies as worker instructions. Only the Coordinator loads and executes workflow bodies; workers follow their canonical role and the Coordinator’s self-contained assignment. Existing developer and technical skill configuration is preserved.

Claude and Codex have launch preparation enabled. Codex prefers an already-running matching-version local daemon for native effective config discovery; otherwise it uses a short-lived stdio app-server and terminates it after config/catalog reads. It never starts or replaces a persistent daemon. Pi, OpenCode, DSH, OMP, and Agy currently fail before mutation for missing or unverified capabilities. Read [adapter evidence and limits](references/adapters.md) before selecting a harness. A prepared argv does not establish account access, model availability, native acceptance, or a successful paid session.

Claude keeps native account-synced, plugin, managed and legacy customizations. Their complete live catalog visibility is unverified and does not prohibit worker preparation. Targeted local workflow overrides preserve unrelated settings; no broad disabling or persistent customization changes occur. See [visibility limits and Codex reader investigation](references/adapters.md#visibility-limits-and-codex-reader-investigation).

`resolve --offline` is fully write-free and reads selection and canonical role only; it returns `launchable: false` and no native argv. It cannot authorize a start.

One versioned JSON result goes to stdout; concise diagnostics go to stderr. Exit codes: `0` resolved/prepared/started; `2` usage or invalid data/config; `3` unavailable executable, Herdr context/kind, or native capability; `4` preparation failure or uncertain post-mutation state. Developer text and native pass-through values are redacted in results. Never treat a failed startup as proof that submission did not occur: inspect the reported pane before launching again.

For launch recovery, exit `2` requires fixing the usage or config error. For exit `3`, read the diagnostic: a missing executable, Herdr context/kind, or native capability can be fixed, after which the same route can be relaunched. Exit `3` does not prove the model or account is unavailable. For exit `4`, inspect the reported pane and its `submission_state` before any relaunch. Never send a new assignment into a session that is still working or waiting for input. Route changes follow the caller's route policy; the launcher itself never falls back.

Private generated material uses the OS temporary root, or existing `--temp-dir DIR`, with restricted permissions. Successful or uncertain launches retain it; the caller removes it after the session ends and state is known. Resolve/dry-run create no launch material or panes, but the no-daemon Codex reader may initialize native runtime state. Do not change persistent user harness settings or install global symlinks.

Pass native arguments after `--`. The bounded supported flags are Codex `--no-alt-screen`, `--sandbox`/`-s`, `--ask-for-approval`/`-a`, `--add-dir`; Claude `--verbose`, `--permission-mode`, `--add-dir`. Value flags accept one value each (repeat `--add-dir` for multiple directories) or `--flag=value`. Accepted argv elements retain their bytes and ordering. Model, effort, role/config, resume, prompt, print, credential, and unknown flags are rejected before mutation. Under the default inherit policy, existing supported native permission flags remain available.

`--permissions inherit|auto-review` defaults to `inherit`. Adapters own the mapping: Claude auto-review uses `--permission-mode auto`; Codex uses `--approve-for-me` (automatic approval review with workspace-write). Neither maps to a bypass mode. Unsupported adapters fail exit 3. With auto-review, native permission/approval/sandbox flags are conflicting and rejected; use the portable option in root wrappers instead of constructing harness flags. Resolve/dry-run report `permissions`; offline reports the requested policy without verifying native support.

Without a daemon, normal Codex resolve/dry-run may initialize Codex runtime files in CODEX_HOME (or configured runtime storage): SQLite state/goals/logs/memories/queue databases and WAL/SHM files, installation_id, bundled `.system` skills/marker, and `.tmp` plugin-lock/git files. The native reader uses actual config layers and environment. User config.toml, AGENTS.md, user-authored skills, profiles and credentials are not written by the launcher or its inspection protocol. Bundled system skills are native runtime assets and may be initialized separately from user-authored skills. Only `resolve --offline` guarantees fully write-free preparation. See [reader evidence and permission policy](references/adapters.md#codex-runtime-state-and-permission-policy).
